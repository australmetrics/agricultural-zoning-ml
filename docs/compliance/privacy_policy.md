# Privacy Policy

**Project**: Pascal Zoning ML  
**Version**: 0.1.0-alpha  
**Effective Date**: 2025-06-05  

---

## 1. Introduction

Pascal Zoning ML (“Project,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is an open-source tool for generating agricultural management zones and optimized sampling points based on spectral-index analysis. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, share, and protect information when you use Pascal Zoning ML or visit our repository/documentation. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and complying with applicable data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).

---

## 2. Scope

This Privacy Policy applies to:

1. **Source code, CLI, and Python API usage**  
2. **Web pages/documentation** (e.g., GitHub repository, hosted docs)  
3. **Issue tracker and discussion forums** associated with this Project  

It does **not** cover third-party websites, services, or software integrated into Pascal Zoning ML (e.g., GitHub, PyPI, CI/CD providers)—those have their own privacy policies.

---

## 3. Information We Collect

### 3.1 Personal Data You Provide Directly

We do not require or request any personally identifiable information (PII) to download, install, or run Pascal Zoning ML. However, when interacting via GitHub Issues or pull requests, you may choose to share:

- **Name, email address, or GitHub username** (your public profile)  
- **Comments or feedback** submitted in issues, pull requests, discussion threads  

All such data is public on GitHub and governed by GitHub’s privacy policy. This Project does not separately store or process PII.

### 3.2 Automatically Collected Information

When you visit our documentation pages or repository on GitHub, the hosting platform (GitHub) may automatically collect:

- **IP address**  
- **Device/browser information**  
- **Referring URL**  
- **Date/time stamps**  
- **Usage metrics** (e.g., pages viewed)

This information is collected by GitHub and/or any static-hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages). We do not directly track or log this data in our codebase.

---

## 4. How We Use Your Information

Since Pascal Zoning ML does **not** collect PII directly, our uses of any data are limited to:

1. **Issue and Pull Request Metadata**  
   - To track feature requests, bug reports, and community contributions.  
   - Public discussion on GitHub is viewable by anyone; we do not use it for marketing.  

2. **Analytics or Telemetry** (optional, user-opt-in only)  
   - If we introduce an optional telemetry feature in a future release—e.g., anonymous usage statistics—we will clearly document it in `README.md` and require explicit opt-in.  
   - Telemetry would only collect non-PII, such as CLI command usage counts or error occurrence rates.  

3. **Documentation Access Logs** (via hosting platform)  
   - Our hosted documentation may collect page view counts, which help us prioritize improvements.  
   - No PII is captured or stored by our code—only aggregate, anonymous metrics.

---

## 5. Sharing and Disclosure

### 5.1 Public Repository Data

- **GitHub Issues/Pull Requests**: Any information you post (e.g., comments, code snippets) is public. We do not “share” it separately; it remains in GitHub’s public history.  

### 5.2 Third-Party Integrations

- We rely on third-party services (e.g., GitHub, PyPI, CI/CD providers) to host code, run tests, and distribute packages. These providers may process data (e.g., your IP when you clone).  
- We do not have direct control over their data practices—please review their privacy policies.

### 5.3 Legal Compliance & Safety

We may disclose information if required by law, regulation, or valid legal request (e.g., subpoena); to enforce our rights; or to protect the safety of users or the public.

---

## 6. Data Security

Although Pascal Zoning ML itself does not collect PII, we take the following measures to keep any project-related data secure:

1. **Secure Development Practices**  
   - Code is reviewed via pull requests; no credentials or secrets are stored in the repository.  
   - Dependencies are pinned in `requirements.txt` and regularly scanned for vulnerabilities (e.g., via `pip-audit`, `bandit`).

2. **Repository Access Controls**  
   - Only authorized maintainers may merge changes to the `main` branch.  
   - GitHub enforces branch protection rules (reviews, CI passing checks).

3. **Documentation Hosting**  
   - Hosted on GitHub Pages (HTTPS) with TLS encryption.  
   - No cookies or trackers are added by our documentation beyond those provided by GitHub Pages.

4. **Optional Telemetry (Future)**  
   - Any telemetry implementation will use secure HTTPS endpoints.  
   - Data in transit will be encrypted; stored data (if any) will not contain PII.

---

## 7. Your Rights

Since this Project does not collect or store your PII directly, the typical “data subject rights” (access, correction, deletion) under GDPR do not apply. However:

- If you post personal data in a GitHub Issue or pull request and wish to remove it, you can edit or delete your GitHub content at any time.  
- To request removal of personal data that appears in historical commits, you can submit a GitHub Support request to remove or redact specific commits (this is subject to GitHub’s policies).

---

## 8. Children’s Privacy

Pascal Zoning ML is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect or store personal data from anyone under 13. If you become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with PII, please contact us immediately so we can delete that information.

---

## 9. International Transfers

This Project is hosted on GitHub, which may store data on servers located in various countries (including the United States). By using GitHub services, information (e.g., IP addresses, code contributions) may be transferred and stored internationally. You agree to such transfers by contributing or visiting the repository.

---

## 10. Updates to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. The “Effective Date” at the top will indicate when the policy was last revised. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

- **Minor Changes** (e.g., formatting, clarifications) do not merit direct notification.  
- **Major Changes** (e.g., new telemetry features, changes in data collection) will be announced in the repository’s `CHANGELOG.md` and via GitHub Releases.
