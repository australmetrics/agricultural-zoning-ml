## Introduction

This statement demonstrates how **Pascal Zoning ML** complies with **ISO 42001: Artificial Intelligence Management System**. It ensures transparent development, secure operations, and ethical use of AI for agricultural zoning.

## Scope

Covers the CLI pipeline (`pascal_zoning.pipeline`), Python API (`AgriculturalZoning`), associated scripts, and documentation workflows.

## Normative References

* ISO 42001:2023 — AI Management System Standard
* ISO 9001:2015 — Quality Management Principles
* ISO 27001:2022 — Information Security Management
* ISO/IEC 27018:2019 — PII Protection in Cloud
* GDPR — EU Data Protection Regulation

## Governance & Organizational Structure

### Roles & Responsibilities

* **Project Owner**: AustralMetrics SpA — oversight, resource allocation, final sign‑off.
* **Technical Lead / AI Engineer**: algorithm design, code reviews, documentation.
* **QA Engineer**: test planning, CI pipelines, coverage monitoring.
* **Data Privacy Officer**: data sourcing compliance, PII review.
* **Security Officer**: access policies, secrets management.

### Policies & Procedures

* **Change Management**: all `src/` updates via PR require peer review, impact analysis, and test updates.
* **Release Management**: semantic versioning, tagged in Git, changelog maintained (`CHANGELOG.md`).
* **AI Ethics Policy**: no PII ingestion; open‑source algorithms ensure reproducibility.

## Documentation & Traceability

### Requirements Traceability

Functional requirements recorded in `docs/interface_spec.md` and linked to test cases in `tests/`. Issue tracker enforces references between issues and requirements.

### Versioned Artifacts

* Source code in Git: commit hashes, PRs, tags.
* Deployment scripts (Dockerfiles) tagged alongside code.
* Model artifacts (future): stored under `models/` with checksums.

### Audit Trail & Logs

* CLI runs produce timestamped logs at `outputs/<TIMESTAMP>_logs/processing.log`.
* Logs record input parameters, warnings, errors, and summaries.
* Archived logs retained in long‑term storage (e.g., S3) for at least 1 year.

## Data Management & Privacy

### Data Sources & Lifecycle

1. **Ingestion**: GeoTIFF and shapefiles supplied by user; geometry-only attributes retained.
2. **Processing**: spectral indices stacked and filtered in memory.
3. **Outputs**: GeoPackage (zones, points), CSV, JSON, and PNG; no PII included.
4. **Retention**: intermediate data ephemeral; final outputs persist until user deletion.

### Privacy Controls

* Drop non‑geometry fields on ingest.
* No user‑level logs or IP tracking.
* GDPR compliance relies on user‑provided consent for field boundary data.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Identified Risks & Controls

| Risk                      | Mitigation                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Garbage‑in → Garbage‑out  | `_validate_indices()` enforces numeric, finite bounds; aborts on invalid inputs.                      |
| Cluster Instability       | Evaluate silhouette & Calinski‑Harabasz over *k* range; fallback raises `ProcessingError` on failure. |
| Zone Filtering Edge Cases | Defaults (`min_zone_size_ha=0.08`) validated; errors raised if thresholds invalid.                    |
| Sampling Collisions       | Spatial inhibition adjusts points or raises errors to avoid silent failures.                          |
| Malicious File Payloads   | Use up‑to‑date `rasterio` & `geopandas`; recommend Docker sandboxing with minimal privileges.         |

## Quality Assurance & Testing

### Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`): each API method and helper.
* **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`): synthetic GeoTIFF workflows.
* **Coverage**: target ≥90%. Run `pytest --cov` to verify coverage.

### CI/CD Pipeline

1. Lint (`flake8`).
2. Type‑check (`mypy`).
3. Test (`pytest`).
4. Security scan (`pip-audit`, `snyk`) quarterly.

## Security & Access Control

### Repository Access

* Protected `main` branch: requires PR review, passing CI, no conflicts.
* Signed commits enforced for release tags.

### Secrets & Credentials

* No secrets in repo.
* CI/CD tokens stored as encrypted GitHub Secrets.

### Runtime Security

* Recommend Docker for sandboxing; restrict network egress.
* Enforce type checks with `mypy` & `pyright` configs.

## Continuous Improvement & Auditing

### Audit Schedule

* **Annual Internal Audit**: governance, risk, tests, logs.
* **Quarterly Security Scan**: documented in Issues; critical fixes within 14 days.
* **External Pen Test**: optional third‑party at least bi‑annual.

### Version Review

* Compliance document reviewed and signed annually (next: 2026‑06‑05).

## Change Tracking

Refer to [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for full history of features, fixes, and breaking changes.
