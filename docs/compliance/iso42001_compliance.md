## 4. Governance & Organizational Structure

### 4.1 Roles and Responsibilities

- **Project Owner** (AustralMetrics SpA)  
  - Ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with ISO 42001.  
  - Maintains the overall roadmap, product vision, and resource allocation.

- **Technical Lead / AI Engineer**  
  - Owns the design and implementation of the zoning algorithms.  
  - Ensures that coding best practices, version control, and documentation are followed.

- **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer**  
  - Designs and executes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.  
  - Maintains test coverage thresholds and monitors automated CI pipelines.

- **Data Privacy Officer**  
  - Reviews data sources (satellite imagery, shapefiles) for privacy compliance.  
  - Confirms that no personally identifiable information (PII) is processed by the zoning pipeline.

- **Security Officer**  
  - Defines access policies for source code, test data, and deployment environments.  
  - Manages secrets and credentials in accordance with ISO 27001 practices.

### 4.2 Policies and Procedures

- **AI Ethics Policy**  
  - Pascal Zoning ML does not ingest any personal data.  
  - All decisions (zoning, sampling recommendations) are transparent and reproducible from open‐source algorithms.

- **Change Management**  
  - All modifications to `src/` require a pull request (PR) with a review from at least one other AI Engineer.  
  - PRs must include:  
    - Summary of changes  
    - Impact analysis (e.g., effect on existing zones, sampling outputs)  
    - Updated or added tests demonstrating no regressions  

- **Release Management**  
  - We follow **Semantic Versioning** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).  
  - Releases are tagged in Git; a CHANGELOG.md is maintained to record new features, bug fixes, and known issues.  
  - A new version is published only after:  
    1. All unit and integration tests pass on the `main` branch.  
    2. A security scan (static analysis) completes with no critical vulnerabilities.  
    3. Documentation (README, API reference, guides) is updated where necessary.

---

## 5. Documentation & Traceability

### 5.1 Requirements Traceability

- All functional requirements (e.g., “mask creation,” “optimal *k* selection,” “zone filtering”) are documented in `docs/interface_spec.md` and `docs/technical/functions_reference.md`.  
- Each requirement is linked to one or more test cases (unit or integration).  
- Issue tracker (GitHub Issues) enforces a policy: every new feature or bugfix must reference a corresponding issue, which in turn references affected requirements.

### 5.2 Versioned Artifacts

- **Source Code**: Tracked in Git; commit hashes, pull requests, and release tags provide full history.  
- **Docker / Deployment Scripts**: If used in production, a Dockerfile (or equivalent orchestration) is tagged with the same version as the code.  
- **Model Parameters & Artifacts** (if any future extension to learnable models): Stored in a `models/` folder with a checksum and accompanying metadata file.

### 5.3 Logging & Audit Trail

- All CLI runs (via `pascal_zoning.pipeline`) generate a timestamped log under `outputs/<TIMESTAMP>_k{K}_mz{MIN}/logs/processing.log`.  
- Each log entry conforms to a standard format:  
- Logs capture:  
- Input parameters (raster path, indices, `--force-k`, `--min-zone-size`, etc.)  
- Intermediate steps (masking counts, cluster metrics, zone counts)  
- Warnings (e.g., “pixels dropped due to NaN values”)  
- Errors (e.g., “No valid pixels found inside polygon”)  
- Final summary (total execution time, number of zones generated, sample point counts)

All logs are versioned if stored in a long‐term storage bucket (e.g., S3) or local archival folder.

## 6. Data Management & Privacy

### 6.1 Data Sources

- **Satellite Imagery** (GeoTIFF)  
- Typically obtained from public repositories (e.g., Sentinel-2) or provided by the client.  
- Contains only spectral bands; no personally identifiable information (PII).

- **Field Boundaries** (Shapefile / GeoPackage)  
- Provided as polygons (e.g., from cadastral databases).  
- May contain owner metadata outside the pipeline; only the geometry is used internally.

### 6.2 Data Lifecycle

1. **Ingestion**  
 - User supplies a clipped GeoTIFF via `--raster` argument.  
 - Field polygon (Shapely `Polygon`) passed via API or derived from the first band of the TIFF.  

2. **Processing**  
 - Pixel‐level operations (stacking spectral indices, filtering NaNs).  
 - No personal data is extracted or stored beyond geometric boundaries.

3. **Storage**  
 - Generated outputs (GeoPackage, CSV, JSON, PNG) contain only:  
   - Zone polygons (no PII)  
   - Sampling point coordinates (no PII)  
   - Per‐zone aggregate statistics (numerical values)  
 - Users must ensure that field boundaries themselves do not carry PII before passing them into the pipeline.

4. **Deletion / Retention**  
 - By default, temporary intermediate arrays (e.g., masked numpy arrays) are not persisted on disk.  
 - Final outputs are retained indefinitely until manually removed by the user.  
 - The pipeline does not implement automatic deletion of old output folders; that behavior is delegated to external scheduler or retention policies.

### 6.3 Privacy Measures

- **No PII Usage**:  
- Pascal Zoning ML never logs or writes owner names, addresses, or other personal attributes.  
- Any shapefile or GeoPackage loaded at runtime is immediately cast to `geometry` type only; all non‐geometry attributes are dropped before processing.

- **Data Minimization**:  
- Only spectral index values and geometry features (polygons, points) are stored in outputs.  
- Raw image bands (e.g., red, NIR, SWIR) exist only in memory during processing, unless the user explicitly passes those TIFFs to downstream storage.

- **Compliance with GDPR** (if used in EU contexts):  
- If a field boundary file contains PII, clients are responsible for obtaining proper consent.  
- Pascal Zoning ML assumes data is supplied in a GDPR-compliant manner; it does not track IP addresses or user‐level logs.

## 7. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### 7.1 Identified Risks

1. **“Garbage In → Garbage Out”**  
 - Risk: If invalid/uncalibrated spectral indices are supplied, clustering results may be meaningless.  
 - Mitigation:  
   - **Validation**: `_validate_indices()` (internal helper) checks that each index array is numeric, finite, and within expected bounds (–1 to 1 for NDVI/NDRE, etc.).  
   - Early abort (raises `ValidationError`) if any index contains all NaN or values outside plausible range.

2. **Cluster Instability**  
 - Risk: K-Means may fail to converge or find distinct clusters if data distribution is degenerate (e.g., all pixels identical).  
 - Mitigation:  
   - Silhouette/Calinski-Harabasz evaluation over *k*=2‒`max_zones`.  
   - If no valid *k* can be found (e.g., only one unique sample), fallback to raise a controlled `ProcessingError` rather than producing incorrect zones.

3. **Zone Filtering Edge Cases**  
 - Risk: All zones get filtered out because minimum area threshold is too high.  
 - Mitigation:  
   - Default `min_zone_size_ha=0.08` (≈ 800 m²) adequate for typical field sizes.  
   - If user sets `--min-zone-size` larger than field area, pipeline raises `ProcessingError` with clear message:  
     > “min_zone_size_ha (X) exceeds total field area (Y), no zones generated.”

4. **Sampling Point Collisions**  
 - Risk: Spatial inhibition algorithm unable to place `points_per_zone` if zone is too small.  
 - Mitigation:  
   - Algorithm chooses max(`points_per_zone`, √N_pixels); if √N > N, simply uses all pixel centers.  
   - If no sampling points can be generated, raises `ProcessingError` rather than returning silent empty results.

5. **Security: Malicious TIFF / Shapefile Contents**  
 - Risk: TIFF or shapefile contains malicious payloads or surprising coordinate systems.  
 - Mitigation:  
   - **Dependency Patching**: Rely on up-to-date `rasterio`, `geopandas`, `shapely`.  
   - **Sandboxing**: Encourage deployment inside isolated environment (Docker, virtualenv) with minimal privileges.  
   - **Input Validation**: Confirm that CRS strings and affine transforms parse correctly; reject invalid geometries.

### 7.2 Risk Owner & Actions

- **Technical Lead** owns the risk registry within `docs/techdebt.md` and tracks mitigation tasks in GitHub Issues.  
- **QA Engineer** verifies that unit/integration tests cover edge cases and that pipeline fails gracefully when encountering risk scenarios.  
- **Security Officer** performs periodic dependency vulnerability scans (e.g., `pip-audit`, `Snyk`) and patches critical issues within 7 days.

## 8. Quality Assurance & Testing

### 8.1 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`)  
- Cover each public method:  
  - `create_mask()` → boolean mask validation.  
  - `prepare_feature_matrix()` → imputation + scaling.  
  - `perform_clustering()` → correct cluster count and metrics.  
  - `extract_zone_polygons()` → correct polygon generation.  
  - `filter_small_zones()` → area threshold enforcement.  
  - `generate_sampling_points()` → spatial inhibition guarantee.  
  - `compute_zone_statistics()` → metrics (area_ha, compactness, mean/std).  
- Assert `ProcessingError` or `ValidationError` in failure modes.

- **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`)  
- Create a small synthetic multi‐band GeoTIFF, run the full CLI pipeline, and assert that:  
  - CLI exits with code 0.  
  - All expected output files (`.gpkg`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.png`) appear.  
  - Produced zone counts and sample points are reasonable given synthetic data.

- **Visual Tests** (manual/optional)  
- Inspect PNG outputs for correct coloring, mask boundaries, and bar charts.  
- Ensure that a CLI invocation with `--use-pca` does not crash.

### 8.2 Test Coverage & Reporting

- **Coverage Target**: ≥ 90% line coverage on `src/pascal_zoning/`.  
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**:  
- GitHub Actions pipeline runs on every PR:  
  1. `pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q`  
  2. `flake8 src/` (no lint errors)  
  3. `mypy src/` (no type‐checking errors except those explicitly disabled)  
- Artifacts (test reports, coverage badges) are published to a central dashboard (e.g., Codecov).

## 9. Security & Access Control

### 9.1 Repository Access

- **GitHub Organization**: AustralMetrics SpA  
- **Branch Protection**:  
- `main` branch requires at least one approving code review, passing CI checks, and no merge conflicts.  
- Use “signed commits” policy for tagged releases (GPG key of Project Owner).

- **Dependency Management**  
- All dependencies pinned in `requirements.txt` with explicit version numbers.  
- `requirements-dev.txt` pins linters, test frameworks, and MyPy plugin versions.  
- Periodic review (monthly) of PyPI for available security patches.

### 9.2 Secrets & Credentials

- **No Secrets in Repo**:  
- Credentials (e.g., cloud keys, database passwords) never stored in source.  
- Use environment variables or a separate secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:  
- Secrets for publishing coverage reports or PyPI tokens stored as encrypted GitHub Secrets.  
- Only exposed to the GitHub Actions workflow when building a tagged release.

### 9.3 Runtime Security

- **Sandboxed Execution**:  
- If deployed in production, run CLI within a Docker container with restricted filesystem permissions.  
- Limit network egress unless explicitly needed.

- **Library Stubs & Type Checking**  
- Use `pyrightconfig.json` and `mypy.ini` to enforce proper typing on all Python modules under `src/pascal_zoning/`.  
- Missing type stubs for third-party packages (e.g., `sklearn`, `rasterio`, `geopandas`) are configured to ignore import errors, but critical portions of our own code require fully typed functions (`disallow_untyped_defs`, etc.).

---

## 10. Continuous Improvement & Auditing

### 10.1 Internal Audits

- **Annual ISO 42001 Audit**  
- Review governance documents, risk register, test coverage, and production logs.  
- Verify that new features introduced in the previous 12 months had corresponding risk assessments and tests.

- **Quarterly Security Scan**  
- Run `pip-audit` and `snyk` in CI to detect new vulnerabilities in dependencies.  
- Document findings in GitHub Issues; fix “critical” or “high” severity within 14 days.

- **Code Review Metrics**  
- Track average time to approve PRs, number of reverts, and # of security findings.  
- Identify bottlenecks in release pipeline and adjust team processes accordingly.

### 10.2 External Audits & Certifications

- **Third-Party Penetration Test** (Optional)  
- Engage an external security firm to attempt to exploit the CLI or API in a sandboxed environment.  
- Publish the high-level findings without revealing sensitive code details.

- **ISO 42001 Certification** (Future)  
- Maintain this compliance document as living evidence for any upcoming formal ISO 42001 certification.  
- Plan to perform gap analysis vs. full ISO 42001 checklist in Q4 2025 and remediate any nonconformities.
