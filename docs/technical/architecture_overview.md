# 1. Introduction

This document provides a structured and professional overview of the **Pascal Zoning ML** system architecture, aligned with the requirements of the **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** standard. It includes design details, governance compliance, traceability, quality, and scalability considerations.

# 2. ISO 42001 Compliance

To ensure ISO 42001 compliance, the system implements:

* **Full traceability**: All operations are recorded with metadata (user, timestamp, version).
* **Strict validation**: Inputs and outputs are checked against defined schemas and value ranges.
* **Reproducibility**: All configurations and dependencies are versioned and stored.
* **Version control**: Critical dependencies are locked and hashed.
* **Assertive documentation**: Up-to-date user guides, API references, and design decisions.
* **Automated testing**: Unit and integration test coverage > 85%.
* **Data governance**: Clearly defined roles (Data Steward, Data Owner), quality oversight, metadata management, and access policies.
* **Privacy and consent policies**: Handling of sensitive data according to local/international regulations, consent recording, role-based access, and encryption of critical data.

## 3.1 Interface Layer

* **CLI (Typer)**: Integrated access and help, argument validation, OAuth2/API Key support, token management.
* **Python API**: REST endpoints with type hints, Sphinx documentation, versioned routes (/v1, /v2), and user-specific rate limiting.

## 3.2 Orchestration Layer

* **ProcessingController** (Command Pattern): Routes commands, handles aggregation and exceptions.
* **Auditing mechanism**: Observer-based progress tracking and logs.

## 3.3 Processing Layer

* **Training & Optimization Pipeline**: Clustering parameters can be tuned via grid search or Bayesian optimization (optional). The system currently uses heuristics based on Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz by default.

* **Model Lineage Tracking**: Each clustering model run logs the exact dataset hash, preprocessing config, and output statistics. Lineage is tracked with UUIDs linking input, config, and results.

## 3.4 Data Layer

* **I/O**: GDAL/Rasterio for raster, GeoPandas/Shapely for vector.
* **Temporary storage**: Memory-mapped with disk fallback.
* **Output formats**: GeoPackage, CSV, JSON, PNG.

## 3.5 Infrastructure Layer

* **Logging (Loguru)**: Structured JSON, configurable rotation, SHA-256 checksums.
* **Configuration (PyYAML + Env)**: Hierarchical values with validation via *pydantic*.
* **Dependency management**: `requirements.txt` with hashes, `pip-compile` enforced.

# 4. Data Flow

* **Data quality validation**: Detect missing values, outliers, duplicates; automated correction and alerting.

| Step                  | Description                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Input validation   | Format, range, CRS, and schema checks            |
| 2. Mask creation      | Thresholding and polygon-based clipping          |
| 3. Feature extraction | Patch-based/sliding-window spectral traits       |
| 4. Index calculation  | Single-pass vectorized index derivation          |
| 5. Clustering         | Training and selection of optimal configuration  |
| 6. Zoning polygons    | Vectorization and spatial statistics computation |
| 7. Sample generation  | Controlled spatial distribution                  |
| 8. Output generation  | File export and traceable logging                |

# 5. Error Management

* **CLI/API Feedback Handling**: The CLI returns clear error codes with remediation tips; API responses include structured JSON messages and all exceptions are traceable in logs with full context and traceback.
* **Exception hierarchy** defined in `errors.py`:

```python
class ZonificationError(Exception): ...
class ValidationError(ZonificationError): ...
class ProcessingError(ZonificationError): ...
class AuthenticationError(ZonificationError): ...
class AuthorizationError(ZonificationError): ...
class RateLimitError(ZonificationError): ...
class NotFoundError(ZonificationError): ...
class ConflictError(ZonificationError): ...
```

* **Standardized HTTP Error Codes (REST API)**:

| HTTP Code | Error Type          | Meaning                                            |
| --------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 400       | ValidationError     | Invalid input (missing fields, wrong format/range) |
| 401       | AuthenticationError | Invalid or expired token                           |
| 403       | AuthorizationError  | Access denied (insufficient privileges)            |
| 404       | NotFoundError       | Missing resource (field, raster, etc.)             |
| 409       | ConflictError       | Inconsistent versioning or duplicate operation     |
| 429       | RateLimitError      | Rate limit exceeded, apply backoff                 |
| 500       | ProcessingError     | Internal system or algorithmic failure             |

* **Error Response Format (JSON)**:

```json
{
  "error_code": "ValidationError",
  "http_status": 400,
  "message": "Detailed technical explanation and resolution tip",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-11T09:00:00Z",
  "request_id": "uuid-v4"
}
```

# 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

# 10. Monitoring & Observability

* Prometheus/Grafana metrics.
* Centralized logs via ELK Stack.
* Alerting on failure and performance degradation.

# 11. Maintenance

* Quarterly dependency updates.
* Refactoring guided by test coverage.
* Configurable result backup retention.

# 12. Integration Points

* GIS software: QGIS, ArcGIS.
* ETL pipelines.
* RESTful connectors and OAuth2 support.

See Section 5 for error handling schemas returned by both CLI and Python API modules.

# 13. Impact Assessment and Risk Controls

* Periodic assessment of model output sensitivity and impact on farming decisions.
* Identification of vulnerable stakeholders and design of mitigation strategies.
* Evaluation of unintended consequences (e.g., over-segmentation, misclassification).
* Human-in-the-loop verification checkpoints.

## 14. Model Version Traceability

* Internal model versions (e.g., Clustering v2.1, FusionModule v1.3) are logged per run.
* All configurations and model states are hashed (SHA-256) and stored in audit logs.
* Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) is followed for API and model modules. Any backward-incompatible change triggers a major version update and is communicated in the changelog.- Internal model versions (e.g., Clustering v2.1, FusionModule v1.3) are logged per run.
* All configurations and model states are hashed (SHA-256) and stored in audit logs.

## 15. Data Provenance

* All input sources (satellite, drone, agronomic data) are logged with acquisition date, CRS, resolution, license, and checksum.
* Licenses and usage policies are validated and version-controlled.
* Input files are versioned using content hashes and optionally tracked using DVC or Git LFS to ensure reproducibility.- All input sources (satellite, drone, agronomic data) are logged with acquisition date, CRS, resolution, license, and checksum.
* Licenses and usage policies are validated and version-controlled.

## 16. Algorithm Governance

* Annual review of core algorithms by internal/external reviewers.
* Validation committee includes agronomists and ML engineers.
* Design decisions and changes are versioned and audit-logged.

## 17. Stakeholder Feedback Loop

* Feedback mechanism embedded in CLI/API to report inconsistencies.
* Feedback tagged, stored, and optionally linked to model retraining cycles.
* Review cycles scheduled quarterly.

## 18. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

* Permissions defined for Operators, Analysts, and Auditors.
* All actions logged with user role, session ID, and timestamp.
* RBAC enforced at API, CLI, and data-access levels.

## 19. Business Continuity & Failover Strategy

* Critical zones and models are backed up daily with automated retention policies.
* If a processing task fails, a retry queue is triggered with exponential backoff.
* Export failures fall back to safe temporary storage and alert the user.
* Recovery time objective (RTO): < 6 hours; recovery point objective (RPO): < 1 day.
