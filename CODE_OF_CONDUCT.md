## 4. Our Standards

### 4.1 Allowed Behavior

- **Be Respectful and Professional.** Treat everyone politely, even if you disagree.  
- **Use Inclusive Language.** Avoid slang, jargon, or colloquialisms that might exclude non-native speakers.  
- **Assume Good Intentions.** If you’re uncertain about someone’s comment, ask for clarification rather than assume hostility.  
- **Focus on Code and Ideas.** Critique the technical or stylistic aspects of code—never attack a person.  
- **Encourage Collaboration.** Offer constructive suggestions, review patches thoughtfully, and welcome new contributors.  
- **Acknowledge Mistakes.** If you’re called out for unacceptable behavior, own it, apologize, and learn from it.

### 4.2 Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

- **Harassment and Hate Speech.** Any demeaning, discriminatory, or threatening language or imagery.  
- **Abusive Comments.** Insults, derogatory slurs, or mocking language.  
- **Sexual Harassment.** Unwanted sexual attention, advances, or comments.  
- **Bullying or Intimidation.** Repeated or severe negative actions targeting an individual.  
- **Excessive Profanity.** Harsh language used to demean or intimidate.  
- **Disrespecting Boundaries.** Pressuring someone to do something they are uncomfortable with.  
- **Inappropriate Self-Promotion.** Spam, excessive advertising of unrelated projects, or personal promotion at the expense of others.  
- **Leaking Private Information.** Posting personal data that is not publicly available (e.g., home addresses, phone numbers).

## 5. Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for reviewing reports of misconduct and enforcing this Code of Conduct. We commit to:

- Responding in a timely manner to concerns raised.

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you witness or experience any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by contacting one of the project maintainers. You can send a private email to:

- **Lead Maintainer:**  
  Email: code-of-conduct@australmetrics.com  
  Subject line: “Pascal Zoning Code of Conduct Report”

A trusted maintainer will acknowledge your report promptly and may request additional information. We will handle all reports with discretion and confidentiality.

## 7. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. Consequences may include:

- A private warning from maintainers.  
- Temporary or permanent removal of project privileges (e.g., blocking a user).  
- Public or private reprimand, depending on the severity of the incident.  

Maintainers reserve the right to take any other action they deem appropriate, including involving external authorities if the misconduct is criminal in nature.
